THERE IS THREE TYPES OF LOAD BALANCER.
1.CLASSIC LOAD BALANCER
IT RESEMBLES THE TRADITIONAL LOAD BALANCING BUT VIRTUAL DEVICES REPLACE THE PHYSICAL HARDWARE.
1.DISTRIBUTES THE INCOMING APPLICATION TRAFFIC ACROSS EC2 INSTANCES IN MULTIPLE AZS AND FUNCTIONS AT LAYER7 OF THE OSI MODEL
2.ROUTES THE TRAFFIC TO HEALTHY INSTANCES ONLY AND IT IS EVENLY DISTRIBUTED
3.INTERNET AND INTERNAL FACING LOAD BALANCER

2.NETWORK LOAD BALANCER
THIS IS USED FOR HANDLING SUDDEN AND VIOLENT SITE TRAFFIC.
1.FUNCTION AT THE 4TH LAYER OF THE OSI MODEL.
2.HANDLES MILLIONS OF REQUESTS PER SECOND AND MAINTAINS LOW LATENCY
3.IDEAL FOR LOAD BALANCING THE TCP TRAFFIC AND SUPPORTS ELASTIC OR STATIC IP

3.APPLICATION LOAD BALANCER
THIS IDENTIFIES THE INCOMING TRAFFIC TYPE AND DIRECTS IT TO THR SPECIFIC RESOURCE
1.FUNCTION AT THE 7TH LAYER OF THE OSI MODEL
2.IDENTIFIES THE INCOMING RESOURCE TYPE AND DIRECTS IT TO THE APPROPRIATE SERVER.

4.GATEWAY LOAD BALANCER
GATEWAY LOAD BALANCING AUTOMATICALLY DISTRIBUTES YOUR INCOMING TRAFFIC ACROSS MULTIPLE TARGETS IN ONE OR MORE AVAIALBILITY ZONES SUCH AS EC2 INSTANCES,CONTAINERS AND IP ADDRESSES.
IT MONITORS THE HEALTH OF ITS REGISTERED TARGESTS AND ROUTES TRAFFIC ONLY TO THOSE THAT ARE IN GOOD CONDITION.

BENEFITS OF GATEWAY LOAD BALANCER
1.DEPLOY THURD PARTY VIRTUAL APPLIANCES MORE QUICKLY
2.SCALE VIRTUAL APPLIANCE WHILE KEEPING COSTS IN CHECK.
3.INCREASE THEAVAILABILITY OF YOUR THIRD-PARTY VIRTUAL APPLIANCE AND CONTINUOSLY MONITOR HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE METRICS.
4.USING GATEWAY LOAD BALANCER ENDPOINTS ENSURE PRIVATE CONNECTIVITY ACROSS THE AWS NETWORK.

WEIGHTED ROUTING
WITH WEIGHTED ROUTING WE CAN SWITCH THE TRAFFIC BETWEEN THE VERSIONS OF OUR APPLICATION.THIS CONFIGURATION ALLOWS US TO CONTROL THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE TRAFFIC TO OUR.
FOR EXAMPLE IF WE DEFINE A RULE HAVING TWO TARGET GROUPS WITH WEIGHT 8 AND 2 THE LOAD

CROSS ZONE LOAD BALANCING

BY DEFAULT CLB NODES DISTRIBUTES THE TRAFFIC TO INSTANCES IN THEIR AVAILABILITY ZONE ONLY.

WE ENABLE CROSS ZONE LOAD BALANCING TP ROUTE EVENLY ACROSS EC2 INSTANCE

CLB ROUTES EACH REQUEST TO THE INSTANCE WITH THE SMALLEST LOAD.

CONNECTION DRAINING
BY ENABLING THIS FEATURE YOU WILL BE ABLE TO BETTER MANAGE THE RESOURCES BEHIND THE ELASTIC LOAD BALANCER SUCH AS REPLACING BACKEND INSTANCES WITHOUT DISRUPTING THE USER EXPERINCE.TAKING AN INSTANCE OUT OF SERVICE AND REPLACING IT WITH A NEW EC2 INSTANCE WITH UPDATED SOFTWARE FOR EXAMPLE WHILE AVOIDING BREAKING OPEN NETWORK CONNECTIONS.


STICKY SESSIONS
STICKY SESSION ALSO KNOWN AS SESSION PERSISTENCE REFERS TO THE PROCESS BY WHICH A LOAD BALANCER ESTABLISHES AN AFFINITY BETWEEN A CLIENT AND A SPECIFIC NETWORK SERVER FOR THE DURATION OF SESSION
(I.E. THE TIME A SPECIFIC IP SPENDS ON A WEBSITE)
STICKY SESSIONS CAN HELP TO IMPROVE USER EXPERIENCE WHILE ALSO OPTIMIZING NETWORK RESOURCE USAGE.

ADVANTAGES OF STICKY SESSION
1.REDUCED DATA EXCHANGE-WHEN USING STICKY SESSIONS,SERVER IN YOUR NETWORK DO NOT NEED TO EXCHANGE SESSION DATE WHICH IS AN EXPENSIVE PROCESS WHEN DONE ON A LARGE SCALE.
2.RAM CACHE UTILIZATION-STICK SESSIONS ENABLE MORE EFFICIENT USE OF YOUR APPLICATION'S RAM CACHE RESULTING IN IMPROVED RESPONSIVENESS.

TYPES OF STICKY SESSION
THERE IS TWO TYPES OF STICKY SESSION
1.DURATION-BASED 
2.APPLICATION-BASED
