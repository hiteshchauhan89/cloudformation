-DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENTS INCLUDE SOURCE CODE AND BUILD REPOSITORIES RESIDING ON SHARED FILE STORAGE THAT SUPPORT MANY DEVELOPERS WORKING ON THE SAME PROJECTS.

AMAZON FSX FOR WINDOWS FILE SERVER

A NATIVE MICROSOFT WINDOWS FILE SYSTEM SO THAT WE CAN MOVE OUR WINDOWS-BASED APPS TO THIS SHARED STORAGE IN AWS.BUILT ON A WINDOWS SERVER,IT HAS GREAT COMPABILITY WITH MICROSOFT PRODUCTS.

WE GET FULL SUPPORT FOR THE SMB PROTOCOL,WINDOWS NTFS AND MICROSOFT ACTIVE DIRECTORY INTEGRATION ALSO FSX USES SSD FOR FAST PERFORMANCE.

SUPPORTED CLIENTS,ACCESS METHODS AND ENVIRONMENTS

1.AMAZON EC2 INSTANCES
2.AMAZON WORKSPACES INSTANCES
3.AMAZON APPSTREAM 2.0 INSTANCE
4.VMWARE CLOUD ON AWS

ACCESS METHODS
1.USING DNS NAMES
2.DISTRIBUTED FILE SYSTEM NAMESPACES

ENVIRONMENT
1.FROM AN ON-PREMISES ENVIRONMENT
2.FROM AN AWS ACCOUNT ANOTHER VPC OR REGION

USE CASES
-MACHINE LEARNING
ML WORLOADS USE MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF TRAINING DATA.MULTIPLE INSTANCES NEED TO PROCESS THIS TRAINING DATA SIMULTANEOUSLY SO A SHARED FILE STORAGE IS VERY HELPFUL

-MEDIA PROCESSING AND TRANCODING
MEDIA WORKFLOWS SUCH AS VIDEO RENDERING AND VISUAL EFFECTS NEED COMPUTE AND STOGARE RESOURCES TO HANDLE THE MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF DATA BEING CREATED.
