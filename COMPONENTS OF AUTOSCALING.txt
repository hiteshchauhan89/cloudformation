AUTO SCALING COMPONENTS:

1.GROUPS
EC2 INSTANCES ARE IN GROUPS SO THAT THEY CAN BE CONSIDERED AS A LOGICAL UNIT(FOR SCALING MANAGEMENT)

WHEN WE CREATE A GROUP WE CAN MENTION THE FOLLOWING ATTRIBUTES THE MAX AND MIN

2.CONFIGURATION TEMPLATES
THESE ARE USED AS CONFIGURATION TEMPLATES FOR THE EC2 INSTANCES

LAUNCH TEMPLATE OR LAUNCH CONFIGURATION IS ALSO USED.

3.SCALING OPTIONS
AUTOSCALING PROVIDES SEVERAL WAYS TO SCALE THE GROUP
-MANUAL SCALING
-DYNAMIC SCALING
-SCALING BASED ON DEMAND OR SCHEDULE

AN AUTOSCALING GROUPS CONTAINS A COLLECTION OF EC2 INSTANCES THAT ARE EXACTLY THE SAME WHILE CREATING AN AUTOSCALING GROUP THE LAUNCH CONFIGURATION MUST BE SPECIFIED AFTER SPECIFYING THE LAUNCH CONFIGURATION CANOT BE CHANGED
NEW INSTANCES ARE LAUNCHED USING A NEW CONFIGURATION
EC2 INSTANCE ARE LAUNCHED AND TERMINATED USING SCALING POLICIES.

CONFIGURATION TEMPLATES
LAUNCH CONFIGURATION IS A TEMPLATE THAT IS USED TO LAUNCH EC2 INSTANCES FOR THE AUTOSCALING PURPOSE.

AUTOSCALING GROUPS USE LAUNCH CONFIGURATION TO LAUNCH INSTANCES

LAUNCH CONFIGURATION CANNOT BE MODIFIED AFTER CREATION IT CAN BE CREATED IN TWO WAYS:
1.FROM SCRATCH:IMAGE ID,INSTANCE TYPE,STORAGE DEVICES, ETC.
2.FROM AN EC2 INSTANCE:ATTRIBUTES FROM THE INSTANCE ARE COPIED.BLOCK DEVICE MAPPING OF THE AMI IS INCLUDED.ANY ADDITIONAL DEVICE THAT WAS ATTAHCED AFTER LAUNCHING THE INSTANCES IS NOT CONSIDERED IN THE LAUNCH CONFIGURATION.

SCALING POLICIES AND ALARMS:
SCALING POLICIES MENTION HOW TO SCALE AND ALARMS DECIDE WHEN TO SCALE CLOUWATCH ALARMS ARE SET TO MONITOR INDIVIDUAL METRICS E.G CPU UTILIZATION ETC WHEN THE THRESHOLD IS BREACHED SCALING POLICIES ARE EXECUTED.

MINIMUM,MAXIMUM AND THEDESIRED CAPACITY

SCALING POLICY
-INCREASE 2 INSTANCES AT A TIME.
-DECREASE 1 INSTANCE AT A TIME.

ALARM
IF CPU UTILIZATION > 80% FOR MORE THAN 10 MINS RING THE BELL

MINIMUM CAPACITY:2
DESIRED CAPACITY:4
MAXIMUM CAPACITY:10

SCALING OPTIONS
SCALING BASED ON A SCHEDULE:THIS TYPE OF A SCLING METHOD IS USED TO SCALE AT A GIVEN TIME AND DATE

SCALING BASED ON DEMAND:HERE SCALING OCCURS WHEN THE CPU UTILIZATION OF THE CURRENT RUNNING INSTANCES GROWS BEYOND A FIXED USAGE LIMIT

SCALING BASED ON A SCHEDULE:
-INCREASE THE INSTANCES BY 2 AT 2:30PM TODAY
-DECREASE THE INSTANCE BY 1 AT 12:00AM TOMORROW

SCALING BASED ON DEMAND:
-IF CPU UTILIZATION > 80% FOR MORE THAN 10 MINS INCREASE THE INSTANCE BY 1
-IF CPU UTILIZATION < 50% FOR MORE THAN 5 MINS DECREASE THE INSATANCE BY 2
